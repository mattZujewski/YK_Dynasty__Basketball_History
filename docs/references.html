      <h2>Dynasty Value Formula</h2>
      <p class="chart-description">
        Every player is assigned a <strong>dynasty value</strong> calculated as:
        <strong>Weighted FPPG &times; Dynasty Multiplier &times; Star Premium &times; GP Modifier</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="chart-description">
        <strong>Weighted FPPG</strong> blends the last three Fantrax seasons (50/30/20 weight, most recent first)
        to smooth out injury years and one-season outliers.
        <strong>Dynasty Multiplier</strong> rewards youth and punishes age: players 22 and under with elite production
        receive up to 1.8&times;, while players 34+ receive 0.7&times;.
        <strong>Star Premium</strong> amplifies elite players: top-5 dynasty assets receive 2.0&times;,
        top-6 through top-15 receive 1.5&times;.
        <strong>GP Modifier</strong> adjusts for durability &mdash; players averaging fewer than 35 games per season
        take a 0.70&times; haircut.
      </p>
      <p class="chart-description">
        Draft picks are valued using a positional table based on the expected pick range given the
        current owner&rsquo;s historical team strength.
        All values are re-evaluated at five points in time (Year 1 through Year 5) as production data
        and player development update the formula inputs.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="chart-section">
      <h2>Trade Grading Systems</h2>
      <p class="chart-description">
        The site runs two parallel grading systems.
        <strong>System A</strong> (Trade Log + Trade Grades pages) uses letter grades (A+ to F)
        based on a blended score: 60% player production value and 40% draft pick value at the time of the trade.
        System A covers all seasons including 2020&ndash;21.
      </p>
      <p class="chart-description">
        <strong>System B</strong> (Trade Cards + Trade Leaderboard + TVOT pages) uses the dynasty value formula
        described above to assign a numeric dynasty value to each side of a trade.
        The side with the higher total dynasty value wins the trade grade.
        System B covers 2021&ndash;22 onward (118 trades as of the last build).
        The two systems agree on the trade winner approximately 58% of the time &mdash;
        disagreements reflect legitimate methodological differences, not errors.
      </p>
      <p class="chart-description">
        Two trades (IDs 99 and 111, both involving the same two owners) are flagged as collusion
        and excluded from all standings, leaderboards, and summary statistics.
        They can be revealed by enabling &ldquo;Include Collusion Flags&rdquo; on the Trade Cards page.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="chart-section">
      <h2>Trade Value Over Time (TVOT)</h2>
      <p class="chart-description">
        The TVOT system re-runs the dynasty value formula at up to five evaluation points after each trade.
        This captures how a trade looks in retrospect &mdash; for example, if a player got injured after the
        trade, or if a draft pick turned into a star.
        A trade that &ldquo;flipped&rdquo; means the initial loser eventually received more dynasty value
        than the initial winner.
        The <strong>swing</strong> metric measures the total dynasty value difference between the biggest
        gap and the smallest gap across all evaluation points.
